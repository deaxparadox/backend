# *Canvas*: Designing Work-flows

If you want to pass the signature of a task invocation to another process or as an argument to another function, for which Celery uses something called *signatures*.

A signature wraps the arguments and execution options of a single task invocation in such a way that it can be passed to functions or even serialized and sent across the wire.

You can create a signature for the add task using the arguments (2, 2), and a countdown of 10 seconds like this:

```py
>>> add.signature((2, 2), countdown=10)
tasks.add(2, 2)
```

There's also a shortcut using star arguments:

```py
>>> add.s(2, 2)
tasks.add(2, 2)
```


### And there's that calling API again...

Signature instances also support the calling API, meaning they have *delay* and *apply_async* methods:

But thereâ€™s a difference in that the signature may already have an argument signature specified. The add task takes two arguments, so a signature specifying two arguments would make a complete signature:


```py
>>> s1 = add.s(2, 2)
>>> res = s1.delay()
>>> res.get()
4
```

But, you can also make incomplete signatures to create what we call *partials*:

```py
# incomplete partial: add(?, 2)
>>> s2 = add.s(2)
```

**s2** is now a partial signature that needs another argument to be complete, and this can be resolved when calling the signature:

```py
# resolves the partial: add(8, 2)
>>> res = s2.delay(8)
>>> res.get()
10
```

Here you added the argument 8 that was prepended to the existing argument 2 forming a complete  signature of add(8, 2).

Keyword arguments can also be added later; these are then merged with any existing keyword arguments, but with new arguments taking precedence:

```py
>>> s3 = add.s(2, 2, debug=True)
>>> s3.delay(debug=False)   # debug is now False.
```

As state, signatures support the calling API: meaning that

- `**sig.apply_async(args=(), kwargs={}, **options)**` : Calls the signature with optional partial arguments and partial keyword arguments. Also supports partial execution options.
- `**sig.delay(*args, **kwargs)**` : Star argument version of apply_async. Any arguments will be prepended to the arguments in the signature, and keyword arguments is merged with any existing keys.

Primitives canvas

- group
- chain
- chord
- map
- starmap
- chunks


There primitives are signature objects themselves, so they can be combined in any number of ways to compose complex work-flows.

#### Note: 

These examples retrieve results, so to try them out you need to configure a result backend. The example project above already does that (see the backend argument to Celery).

### Groups

A **group** calls a list of tasks in parallel, and it returns a special result instance that lets you inspect the results as a group, and retrieve the return values in order.

```py
>>> from celery import group
>>> from proj.tasks import add

>>> group(add.s(i, i) for i in range(10))().get()
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

- Partial group

```py
>>> g = group(add.s(i) for i in range(10))
>>> g(10).get()
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
```


### Chains

Tasks can be linked together so that after one task returns the other is called:

```py
>>> from celery import chain
>>> from proj.tasks import add, mul

# (4 + 4) * 8
>>> chain(add.s(4, 4) | mul.s(8))().get()
64
```

or a partial chain:

```py
>>> # (? + 4) * 8
>>> g = chain(add.s(4) | mul.s(8))
>>> g(4).get()
64
```

Chains can also be written like this:

```py
>>> (add.s(4, 4) | mul.s(8))().get()
64
```

### Chords 

A chord is a group with a callback:

```py
>>> from celery import chord
>>> from proj.tasks import add, xsum

>>> chord((add.s(i, i) for i in range(10)), xsum.s())().get()
90
```

A group chained to another task will be automatically converted to a chord:

```py
>>> (group(add.s(i, i) for i in range(10)) | xsum.s())().get()
90
```

Since these primitives are all of the signatures type they can be combined almost however you want, for example:

```py
>>> upload_document.s(file) | group(apply_filter.s() for filter in filters)
```
