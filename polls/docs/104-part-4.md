# Part 4

## Writing more views

Now let’s add a few more views to `app/views.py`. These views are slightly different, because they take an argument:

```py
def detail(request, question_id):
    return HttpResponse("You're looking at question %s." % question_id)


def results(request, question_id):
    response = "You're looking at the results of question %s."
    return HttpResponse(response % question_id)


def vote(request, question_id):
    return HttpResponse("You're voting on question %s." % question_id)
```

Wire these new views into the `app.urls` module by adding the following `path()` calls:


```py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # ex: /polls/
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
    # ex: /polls/5/
    path("<int:question_id>/", views.detail, name="detail"),
    # ex: /polls/5/results/
    path("<int:question_id>/results/", views.results, name="results"),
    # ex: /polls/5/vote/
    path("<int:question_id>/vote/", views.vote, name="vote"),
]
```

Take a look in your browser, at “/polls/34/”. It’ll run the `detail()` method and display whatever ID you provide in the URL. Try “/polls/34/results/” and “/polls/34/vote/” too – these will display the placeholder results and voting pages.

## Write views that actually do something¶

Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an `HttpResponse` object containing the content for the requested page, or raising an exception such as `Http404`. The rest is up to you.

Because it’s convenient, let’s use Django’s own database API. Here’s one stab at a new index() view, which displays the latest 5 poll questions in the system, separated by commas, according to publication date:



```py
from django.http import HttpResponse

from .models import Question


def index(request):
    latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
    output = ", ".join([q.question_text for q in latest_question_list])
    return HttpResponse(output)


# Leave the rest of the views (detail, results, vote) unchanged
```



If you want to change the way the page looks, you’ll have to edit this Python code. So let’s use Django’s template system to separate the design from Python by creating a template that the view can use.

First, create a directory called `templates` in your app directory. Django will look for templates in there.


Within the templates directory you have just created, create another directory called app, and within that create a file called `index.html`. In other words, your template should be at app/templates/app/index.html. Because of how the app_directories template loader works as described above, you can refer to this template within Django as app/index.html.

```py
{% if latest_question_list %}
    <ul>
    {% for question in latest_question_list %}
        <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% else %}
    <p>No polls are available.</p>
{% endif %}
```

Now let’s update our index view in app/views.py to use the template:

```py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader

from .models import Question


def index(request):
    latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
    template = loader.get_template("polls/index.html")
    context = {
        "latest_question_list": latest_question_list,
    }
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
```

### A shortcut: render()

```py
def index(request):
    latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
    context = {"latest_question_list": latest_question_list}
    return render(request, "app/index.html", context)
```

The `render()` function takes the request object as its first argument, a template name as its second argument and a dictionary as its optional third argument. It returns an `HttpResponse` object of the given template rendered with the given context.

### Raising a 404 error

Now, let’s tackle the question detail view – the page that displays the question text for a given poll. Here’s the view:

```py
from django.http import Http404
from django.shortcuts import render

from .models import Question


# ...
def detail(request, question_id):
    try:
        question = Question.objects.get(pk=question_id)
    except Question.DoesNotExist:
        raise Http404("Question does not exist")
    return render(request, "app/detail.html", {"question": question})
```


The view raises the Http404 exception if a question with the requested ID doesn’t exist.


## A shortcut: get_object_or_404()

It’s a very common idiom to use get() and raise Http404 if the object doesn’t exist. Django provides a shortcut. Here’s the detail() view, rewritten:

```py
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render

from .models import Question


# ...
def detail(request, question_id):
    question = get_object_or_404(Question, pk=question_id)
    return render(request, "app/detail.html", {"question": question})
```
